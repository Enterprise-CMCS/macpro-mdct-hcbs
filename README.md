HCBS is the CMCS MDCT application for collecting state data related to Home- and Community-Based Services (HCBS) programs and performance. The collected data assists CMCS in monitoring, managing, and better understanding Medicaid and CHIP programs.

HCBS are types of person-centered care delivered in the home and community which address the needs of people with functional limitations who need assistance with everyday activities. They are often designed to enable people to stay in their homes, rather than moving to a facility for care. The programs generally fall into two categories: health services (which meet medical needs) and human services (which support activities of daily living).
